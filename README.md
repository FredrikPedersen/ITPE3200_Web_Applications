# ITPE3200 - Web Applications
Repo for the final project in [ITPE3200 - Web Applications](https://student.oslomet.no/en/studier/-/studieinfo/emne/ITPE3200/2018/H%C3%98ST) Autumn 2019.
Earlier in the course we had done two graded team projects focused on developing a clone of Vy's trip planner website, with the main workload centered around the backend. In this final solo project we were to have a simple backend and focus on developing a solid singlepage client application.
